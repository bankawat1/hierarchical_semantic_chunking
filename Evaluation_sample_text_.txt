Tourism in China is a growing industry that is becoming a significant part of the Chinese economy. The rate of tourism has expanded over the last few decades since the beginning of reform and opening-up. The emergence of a newly rich middle class and an easing of restrictions on movement by the Chinese authorities are both fueling this travel boom. China has become one of world's largest outbound tourist markets. According to Euromonitor International, economic growth and higher incomes in nearby Asian countries will help China to become the world's number one tourist destination by 2030.[1]
China ranked second in the world for travel and tourism's contribution to GDP in 2022 ($814.1 billion), and first in the world for travel and tourism's contribution to employment (66,086,000 jobs in 2014).[2] Tourism, based on direct, indirect, and induced impact, accounted for 9.3 percent of China's GDP in 2013.[3] In 2017, the total contributions of China's Travel and Tourism sector made up 11% of its GDP.[4] In 2018, the domestic tourism sector contributed around US$1.47 trillion to the nation's GDP.[5]
Since 2012, tourists from China have been the world's top spender in international tourism, leading global outbound travel. In 2016, the country accounted for 21% of the world's international tourism spending, or $261 billion.[6] (The stats include journeys made to the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as Taiwan; in 2017, these accounted for 69.5m of the so-called "overseas" journeys.) As of 2018, only 7% of Chinese had a passport, so the "potential for further growth is staggering", according to a UK news report.[7]
The first Chinese-operated travel agency, in China was founded by banker Chen Guangfu in 1923.[8]: 89  Tourism began emerging as part of bourgeois lifestyle and a nascent industry during China's nationalist era.[8]: 91 
After the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, tourism was not a contributing sector of the company's economy due to the PRC's political system and the political and economic blocks imposed on China by Western countries.[8]: 91  China's tourism bureau was a government agency handled tourism matters viewed as important to China's foreign relations.[8]: 91–92  The state-owned tourism company China International Travel Service (CITS) as established in 1954.[8]: 93  "International" in this context referred to diplomacy.[8]: 93  The PRC's earliest tourists came from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.[9]: 117  In 1958, the Secretary-General of the State Council was placed in charge of CITS and its branches were transferred to local governments.[8]: 92 
Organized around diplomatic and political purposes, tourism in China provided tours such as the production study tour (shengchan guanmo tuan) or the industry and commerce study tour (gongshang kaocha tuan).[8]: 92  Premier Zhou Enlai stated that the purpose of tourism was "to xuanchuan ourselves, understand others, wild influence, and gain sympathy".[8]: 93  Through CITS, China provided travel service to overseas Chinese visiting China and tourists who might spread a positive image of China to their home countries.[8]: 94 
In 1964, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress approved the creation of the China Travel and Tourism Enterprise Administration (CTEA), which later became the China National Tourism Administration.[8]: 94 
In the early phases of the Cultural Revolution, international tourism came to a halt.[9]: 117  In this period, Red Guards denounced China Travel Service and CITS for their foreign connections.[9]: 117  The issue of tourism became less contentious again in 1970.[9]: 117  At the 1971 National Tourism Work Conference, tourism was deemed an important part of China's foreign affairs work.[9]: 117  Between 1971 and 1978, the number of foreigners admitted through CTEA increased by a factor of 20, and its earnings of foreign currency increased by a factor of nearly 120.[9]: 117 
In 1977, the National Tourism Planning forum stated that the mission of tourism was to earn foreign currency to fund the Four Modernizations.[9]: 131  Beginning in 1978 and 1979, Deng Xiaoping promoted the development of tourism for purposes of economic development.[8]: 97  As tourism became an important means of obtaining foreign currency for the government, China emphasized its exotic qualities to international tourists.[9]: 18

By 1980, China's tourism business was booming.[9]: 136  The expansion of domestic and international airline traffic and other tourist transportation facilities made travel more convenient. Over 250 cities and countries had been opened to foreign visitors by the mid-1980s. Travellers needed only valid visas or residence permits to visit 100 locations; the remaining locales required travel permits from public security departments. In 1985 approximately 1.4 million foreigners visited China, and nearly US$1.3 billion was earned from tourism.[10]
In 2015, China was the fourth most visited country in the world, after France, United States, and Spain, with 56.9 million international tourists per year.[11] In 2017, tourism contributed about CNY 8.77 trillion (US$1.45 trillion), 11.04% of the GDP, and contributed direct and indirect employment of up to 28.25 million people. There were 139.48 million inbound trips and five billion domestic trips.[12][13]
In 2018, the Chinese hotel industry had a large pipeline of 2,500 new hotel projects.[4]

Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local.[7] Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in India is 10:3.[8]
Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste, religion, language, and disability.
Education in India has much room for growth, such as improving access to education, increasing the quality of education,[9] reducing disparities, lowering dropout rates, increasing enrolment and completion rates,[10] enhancing learning outcomes and employability, strengthening governance and accountability, promoting innovation and technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. It is influenced by various policies and programmes at the national and state levels, such as the National Education Policy 2020, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, the Midday Meal Scheme, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, and the National Digital Education Architecture. It is also supported by various stakeholders and partners, such as UNICEF, UNESCO, World Bank, civil society organizations, academic institutions, private sector entities, and media outlets.
Education in India is plagued by issues such as grade inflation,[11] corruption, unaccredited institutions offering fraudulent credentials and lack of employment prospects for graduates.[12][13] Half of all graduates in India are considered unemployable.[14]
Until 1976, under the Indian constitution, each state was responsible for the schools that fell under its governance; states possessed full jurisdiction over creating and implementing education policies. After the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution of India was passed in 1976, education fell under the concurrent list,[15] which allowed the federal government (also known as the central government) to recommend education policies and programmes, even if state governments continued to wield extensive autonomy in implementing these programmes.[15] In a country as large as India, with 28 states and eight union territories, this has created vast differences between states' policies, plans, programmes, and initiatives relating to school education. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programmes and policies. State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously, the number and proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-2006, 83.13% of schools offering elementary education (Grades 1–8) were managed by government, and 16.86% of schools were under private management (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the Education Guarantee Scheme and in alternative learning centres). Of those schools managed privately, one third are 'aided' and two thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment in Grades 1–8 is shared between government and privately managed schools in the ratio 73:27. However, in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in urban areas much lower (36:66).[16]
In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was reported to be literate, with 81% for males and 65% for females. National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18, 84.7% for male and 70.3% for female.[17] This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%.[18] India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[19][20] Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrolment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of 26.3% in 2019,[21] there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations,[22] a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population.[citation needed]
Demand for private schools has been growing over the years.[23]While a consensus over what is the most significant driver of this growth in private schooling has not yet emerged, some authors have attributed this to a higher demand for English-medium education[24], a dissatisfaction with the quality of public schools,[25][26] greater affordability of private schools,[23] and non-availability of preferred field of study in government schools.[27] After the adoption of the Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009, private schools were required to be 'government-recognised'. A private school would be eligible for government recognition when it met certain conditions.[23]
At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.[28] Certain post-secondary technical schools are also private. The private education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but is projected to be a US$40 billion market.[29]

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, used to create agent and multi-agent workflows. Compared to other LLM frameworks, it offers these core benefits: cycles, controllability, and persistence. LangGraph allows you to define flows that involve cycles, essential for most agentic architectures, differentiating it from DAG-based solutions. As a very low-level framework, it provides fine-grained control over both the flow and state of your application, crucial for creating reliable agents. Additionally, LangGraph includes built-in persistence, enabling advanced human-in-the-loop and memory features.
LangGraph is inspired by Pregel and Apache Beam. The public interface draws inspiration from NetworkX. LangGraph is built by LangChain Inc, the creators of LangChain, but can be used without LangChain.
LangGraph Platform is infrastructure for deploying LangGraph agents. It is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications to production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework. The LangGraph Platform consists of several components that work together to support the development, deployment, debugging, and monitoring of LangGraph applications: LangGraph Server (APIs), LangGraph SDKs (clients for the APIs), LangGraph CLI (command line tool for building the server), LangGraph Studio (UI/debugger),
To learn more about LangGraph, check out our first LangChain Academy course, Introduction to LangGraph, available for free here. One of the central concepts of LangGraph is state. Each graph execution creates a state that is passed between nodes in the graph as they execute, and each node updates this internal state with its return value after it executes. The way that the graph updates its internal state is defined by either the type of graph chosen or a custom function.
Let's take a look at a simple example of an agent that can use a search tool. LangGraph Platform is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications to production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework. Here are some common issues that arise in complex deployments, which LangGraph Platform addresses:
Streaming support: LangGraph Server provides multiple streaming modes optimized for various application needs
Background runs: Runs agents asynchronously in the background
Support for long running agents: Infrastructure that can handle long running processes
Double texting: Handle the case where you get two messages from the user before the agent can respond
Handle burstiness: Task queue for ensuring requests are handled consistently without loss, even under heavy loads
